# 🤵 Agent 402

Drive your Lambo while Agent 402 extracts alpha and trades the market.

## ⚡ About

Agent 402 is an AI agent for Cronos that utilizes the x402 protocol to execute trades powered by private Telegram channels and other premium data sources.

## 💡 Motivation

There are thousands of Telegram channels providing paid crypto analytics.

Conversely, there are even more users paying for this information, trying to find trading insights across hundreds of posts every day.

This situation is a great opportunity for an agent to emerge that can help both sides.
